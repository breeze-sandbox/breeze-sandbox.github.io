Breeze Documentation Site for testing

Currently work-in-progress prototype for future home page.

## Structure Notes

As it stands, the code for header and footer are repeated on every page.  We can remove this by
using jekyll to build the site from templates, but that makes it more difficult to run the site
locally.

## Content Notes

Do we have **too many** social media links?  Which ones should we cut out?

How much bio information should we have in the About Us page?  Can we zoom out the headshots somehow?

## What we are missing

1. ?
2. ??
